/**
 * This class demonstrates the dangers of a deadlock. You can run the method
 * {@link #simulateTransfersDeadlock()} and observe the program can't complete as the
 * threads running that method will deadlock. "Deadlock" is a situation where
 * a thread hold a synchronization lock on an object A and is trying to acquire
 * a lock on object B, but another thread has object B already locked and is
 * trying to acquire a lock on A. Neither thread can make progress. Deadlocks
 * are bugs from which the program can not recover; you should write your code
 * so that it can not deadlock. A deadlock can arise with more than two threads
 * in which every thread holds an object the next thread waits on, and the last
 * thread waits on an object held by the first thread, forming a circular
 * locking dependency.
 *
 * In our case, the cause of the deadlock is that different threads might attempt
 * to obtain the synchronized locks on {@link BankAccount} objects in different
 * order. The method {@link #simulateTransfersNoDeadlock()} shows a solution to
 * the issue where the method always ensures bank account with smaller index is
 * locked first.
